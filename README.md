# Modern JavaScript Mastery

This repository serves as a structured log of my journey through the JavaScript ecosystem. My goal is to move beyond syntax to understand the "how" and "why" behind the language, focusing on writing clean, performant, and scalable code.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

* **Core Fundamentals:** Mastering ES6+ syntax, scope, closures, and the prototype chain.
* **Asynchronous Patterns:** Deep diving into Promises, Async/Await, and the Event Loop.
* **Functional & OOP Patterns:** Implementing design patterns to solve complex problems.
* **Modern Tooling:** Exploring Vite, NPM, and testing frameworks like Jest.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `/fundamentals`: Exercises on core syntax and ES6 features.
* `/logic-challenges`: Algorithmic problem-solving using JS.
* `/mini-projects`: Small-scale functional applications.
* `/notes`: Deep dives into complex topics and "aha!" moments.

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

Throughout this process, I am focusing on **Industry Best Practices**:

* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Abstracting logic into reusable functions.
* **Clean Code:** Prioritizing readability and meaningful naming conventions.
* **Debugging:** Utilizing DevTools and technical documentation to solve bottlenecks independently.
