/**
 * Asychronous Patterns:
 * -Events(actions that occur in the browser due to user interaction)
 * -Callbacks(this is a function passed as a parameter to another function
 *      intended to be executed later due to an event)
 * -Promises(this represent a vaue that may be avalable at anytime or not at all)
 * -Async/Await(cleaner and more modern way of writting asynchronous code)
